# Geographic Boundaries

To be created - a script that fetches global boundaries data (https://data.hdx.rwlabs.org/dataset/lsib-lines-global-simplified) and converts to RDF in a way that can be queried either using GeoSPARQL (http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/geosparql) or Virtuoso's built in functions for geographic searches.

ToDo:

* Check for Virtuoso GeoSPARQL support

Use cases: 

* Locate all the sites within the boundaries of a given country
* Display a country on a map
